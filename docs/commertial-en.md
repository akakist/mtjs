# MTJS: High-Performance JavaScript Runtime

## üöÄ What is MTJS?

**MTJS** is a high-performance JavaScript runtime built on the **Megatron** architecture and **QuickJS** engine. The solution combines JavaScript development speed with native code performance, offering unique advantages for modern backend applications.

## üéØ Why MTJS? Problems with Traditional Approaches

### Node.js and V8: Architecture for Browsers

Node.js is built on V8, which was originally designed for browsers. This leads to fundamental problems:

- **JIT compilation** makes sense for browsers but takes significant time on the backend
- **JS computations** in browsers cannot be moved "under the hood"
- **Algorithms in JS** will always be slower than equivalent C/C++ implementations
- **WebAssembly** in V8 is a compromise, not a solution

### Problems with NPM Ecosystem

- **Update attacks** - plugin code modification
- **Hidden miners** and malicious code in dependencies
- **Automatic infection** during deployment
- **Need to audit 500+ modules** by security teams

## üèóÔ∏è MTJS Architecture

**Workflow advantages:**

1. **Rapid Prototyping**
   - Build MVP with JS - fast and efficient
   - Code errors don't crash the server
   - Experiment without stability risks

2. **Gradual Optimization**
   - Move bottlenecks under the hood after algorithm debugging
   - C/C++ code delivers maximum performance
   - JS is treated as potentially optimizable code

3. **Growth Readiness**
   - MTJS is already 10-20x faster than Node.js
   - We have performance reserves

## üí° Key Advantages of MTJS

### ‚ö° Performance

**Current results:**
- **550,000 RPS** on standard hardware
- **Memory consumption**: 50-100MB
- **Startup time**: < 100ms
- **Binary size**: 8MB static build

**Performance comparison:**

| Parameter | Node.js/V8 | MTJS | Improvement |
|-----------|------------|------|-------------|
| HTTP RPS | 20-50k | **550k** | **10-20x** |
| Memory | 500MB-1GB | **50-100MB** | **10x** |
| Startup | 2-5 sec | **< 100ms** | **20-50x** |
| Binary | 100MB+ | **8MB** | **12x** |

### üîí Security

**MTJS solution:**
- 8MB static binary
- Only verified libraries
- No automatic external updates
- Minimal attack surface

**Security savings:**
- Audit 1 binary vs 500 NPM modules
- No supply chain attack risk
- Full control over entire codebase

### üõ†Ô∏è Development

**JavaScript as "Control Interface":**

JS should be considered as control elements - buttons, steering wheel, pedals. This is the interface used to control the backend engine hidden under the hood.

If we don't have complex computations in JS, only object manipulation, we get a highly adaptive backend configuration with power unavailable in nginx.conf.

## üí∞ MTJS Business Benefits

### Economic Efficiency
- **80% infrastructure savings** - fewer servers, higher density
- **75% security cost reduction** - minimal audits, no incidents
- **60% fewer DevOps engineers** - easier management and deployment

### Operational Excellence
- **Guaranteed 99.99% availability** - predictable performance under load
- **Instant scaling** - linear scaling to millions of RPS
- **Fast deployments** - seconds instead of minutes

### Strategic Advantages
- **3x faster time-to-market** - rapid iterations
- **Technical leadership** - 10x faster than competitors
- **New markets** - opportunities for high-frequency, real-time solutions

### Risk Reduction
- **No vendor lock-in** - full control over the stack
- **Incident protection** - avoid downtime losses
- **Compliance out-of-the-box** - meets security standards

## üìä Performance in Numbers

### Benchmarks (standard hardware)
- **HTTP API**: 550,000 RPS
- **JSON serialization**: 2.1M operations/sec
- **Memory consumption**: 50MB under load
- **Response time**: < 1ms (p95)

### Scalability

- 1 server: 550k RPS
- 10 servers: 5.5M RPS (linear scaling)
- 100 servers: 55M RPS
